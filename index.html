 <h1> <strong> <mark> Anthony Hoang </mark> </strong> </h1>

  <p> Hello, as you can tell by the heading, my name is <b> Anthony Hoang </b>. I attend <u> DeWitt Clinton High School </u> and I'm currently a <i> sophomore </i>. My school experience so far has been interesting, the first year was more of an introductory year where I got to find myself more and this year I started working harder for my future.</h2>

  <p> <b> In 3 years </b> from now, I see myself hopefully working a job of some sort, preferably in the <u>computer science</u> area whether that be freelancing, <i> software devlopment </i>, etc. I also see myself either in college/trade school, but we'll see as the years go by. </p>
